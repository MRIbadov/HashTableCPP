## HashTable Implementation in C++
# Overview
This project implements a HashTable data structure in C++ using separate chaining for collision resolution. The HashTable allows for efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs, where keys are integers and values are strings. It supports basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching.

# Features
Insertion of key-value pairs into the HashTable
Deletion of key-value pairs from the HashTable
Searching for values associated with a given key
Checking if the HashTable is empty
Displaying the contents of the HashTable
# Usage
To use the HashTable in your C++ program, follow these steps:

Include the Hashtable.h header file in your program.
Create an instance of the Hashtable class.
Insert key-value pairs using the insertItem method.
Remove key-value pairs using the removeItem method.
Search for values associated with keys using the Search method.
Check if the HashTable is empty using the isEmpty method.
Display the contents of the HashTable using the printable method.
